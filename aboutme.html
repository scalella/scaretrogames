        <h1>M.S. Retro Games</h1>
        <p> Hello! My name is Martin Scalella, and I am a fullstack developer with experience in designing and developing web applications.  This website is a personal project I have undertaken to enhance my JavaScript skills and explore new development techniques. <br> The primary goal of this project is to create an application that dynamically controls the viewport and responds to keyboard input. This involves implementing advanced DOM manipulation functionalities and handling keyboard events to allow for smooth, real-time interaction. <br> The choice of a minimalist aesthetic is intentional; it is inspired by the monochromatic monitors of the past, aiming to evoke a sense of nostalgia and simplicity that contrasts with modern graphical interfaces. This retro design serves as a tribute to the early days of computing, where efficiency and functionality were paramount. <br> In this project, I have focused on applying solid development principles, such as code modularity and separation of concerns, to ensure a clean and maintainable codebase. Through this exercise, I hope not only to strengthen my technical skills but also to inspire other developers to embark on their own challenging and creative.</p>
